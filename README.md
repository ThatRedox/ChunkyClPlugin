# OpenCL Plugin

This is a plugin for [Chunky](https://github.com/chunky-dev/chunky) which harnesses the power of the GPU with OpenCL 1.2+ to accelerate rendering.

#### This is currently a work in progress and does not support many features. The core renderer itself is still under development so render results may change drastically between versions.

## Installation

### Note: This requires the `2.5.0` snapshots.
Download the latest plugin build and extract it. In the Chunky Launcher, expand `Advanced Settings` and click on `Manage plugins`. In the `Plugin Manager` window click on `Add` and select the `.jar` file in the extracted zip file. Click on `Save` and start Chunky as usual.

Select `ChunkyCL` as your renderer for the scene in the `Advanced` tab.

## Performance

Rough performance with a RTX 2070 is around 400 times that of the traditional CPU renderer as of 2022-01-27.

Some settings have been added to improve render performance.
* Indoor scenes should disable sunlight under `Lighting`
* Draw depth may be adjusted under `Advanced`
* Draw entities may be unchecked under `Advanced`
* OpenCL Device selector under `Advanced`

## Compatibility

* Not compatible with the Denoising Plugin.

## Development
This project is setup to work with IntelliJ and CLion. The base directory is intended to be opened in IntelliJ and the `src/main/opencl` directory in CLion.

For hot reloading, add `-DchunkyClHotReload="<src/main/opencl directory>"` as a JVM option.
